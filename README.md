# DoOrDie-Application

Do or Die is a game for people to get good at solving puzzles using math, thus enhancing their critical thinking skills. This game is not only for people who love math, its a game that will keep any competitive person engaged by presenting new challenges with every level completed. The game is made up of three differente levels, easy, intermediate, and difficult. It is a game that you will download on your android device to be played by one person at the time only. In level one, the player is given an empty 3 by 3 grid, your goal is to add a unique number from 1 to 9 to in every cell until the grid is completely full. Remember, the goal is not to add just any number in each cell, first you have to think ahead and strategize because at the end you want the sum of every colum, row, and diagonal to be equal. The way you add a number to a cell is by clicking on it, the first time you click on a cell the number 1 will be written and you cannot erase it, then you move to any other cell you want as long as it is empty and click it to write the number two, then the number three on any empty cell, etc. The strategy is to know where each number should be placed before hand, so that you know which cell to click each time. However, if you dont know where to place each number, you can always play around with the grid. Do a couple trial and error and reset the board each time you make a mistake by clicking the restart button to clear the board. If the you get stuck you can always click the skip level button to go to level 2 or 3.

### Motivation

I was motivated to create this game about a year ago because I wanted to come up with a virtual game, somewhat like sudoku, that people of any age, education level, and ethnicity could use to enhance their matematical and critical thinking skills.

### This game was built using

* for the creation of this application I used virtual studio
* I also used eclipse to test some of the java code

### Features

Some of the features that make my game different are:
*The user does not input any values mannually, the first click will set the number one and then I will increment the value with each click
* The levels of difficulty, first the game starts somewhat easy, and as you advanced to the next levels it gets more complex
* It enhances your brain to think fast and accurately, by giving its players as many chances to come up with the right solution to a difficult problem. 
* Gives the players time to think and plan their next move by allowing them to see their updated grid every time they fill in part of the grid.

### Code Example

Below I have included the three most important chunks of code for my game:



### Installation

The libraries imported in order to create this game were:
*import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
*import android.os.Bundle;

### How to use?

To play this game, first, click the clone or download project from this repository. Then open the downloaded repository in android studio. select a virtuall device to run download the application on. If you do not have a virtual device created, go ahead and open the AVD Manager in virtual studio to create one. This game runs on 98% of android devices, so feel free to download whichever phone you like best. then click the green triangle(Run) to download and run the Do or Die app on your virtual device. 

1. Once you have clicked the run button, the app will install and you will start the game at level 1. As pictured below, this level is the 3 by 3 empty grid wich you need to fill in so that it becomes a magic square. You can always click the restart button on the upper right hand corner to empty the grid and start over.

2. After completing level 1, you will automatically advance to level two. Level 2, as seen below, is a bit more challenging because you are require to solve a four by four magic square. Again, you can always click restart to start this level again or should you choose to skip the level, just hit the skip level buttom on the buttom of the screen.

3. The last level is #3. This level is much more complex than the previous 2. The grid is now a five by 5. Take your time, calculate each move, and the restart button allows you to try as many times a you wish.
